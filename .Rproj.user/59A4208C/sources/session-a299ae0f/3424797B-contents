## Book Project

- **The Political Determinants (and Deterrents) of Public Administration Careers in Developing Countries**  
  Building on previous findings, this book project examines how political factors—both at the macro level (e.g., democracy, populism, political instability) and the micro level (e.g., ideologies, identity-based exclusion)—influence the attractiveness and durability of public administration careers among tertiary-educated professionals in low- and middle-income democracies. It analyzes these political dynamics in relation to widely recognized determinants such as salary, pro-social motivations, and career incentives, with the aim of developing a political theory of public sector careers in developing country contexts.
