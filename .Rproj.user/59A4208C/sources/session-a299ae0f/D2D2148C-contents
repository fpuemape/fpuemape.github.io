:::: {#hero-heading}
I hold a Ph.D. in Political Science from Temple University, where I specialized in comparative politics and international relations, with a regional emphasis on Latin America. I also earned an M.A. in Political Science from Temple and a B.A. in Political Science from the Pontificia Universidad Católica del Perú.

My research explores the political determinants of public sector human capital—particularly how political instability, executive corruption, ideology, and socio-political identities shape the recruitment and retention of tertiary-educated professionals for elected and non-elected positions. I employ a mixed-methods approach that combines observational analysis, ethnographic fieldwork, and experimental research.

I have taught courses at both public and private universities in the United States and Latin America.
