It analyzes these political dynamics in relation to widely recognized determinants such as salary, pro-social motivations, and career incentives, with the aim of developing a political theory of public sector careers in developing country contexts.\n\n## Paper under Review and Resubmit (R&R)\n\n- *The Limits of Movementism: Goal-Oriented Bureaucrats Resisting Resource Mobilization*  \n\n## Paper under Review\n\n- *Political Instability and Public Administration Attractiveness: Evidence from a Conjoint Experiment in Peru*\n- *Political Instability and the Erosion of Public Administration Careers: Evidence from Latin America*\n\n## Working Papers\n\n- *The Criminal Origins of Social Identities: Identity Entrepreneurship Among Corrupt Politicians*\n- *The Technocratic Origins of Sectoral Strategic Value: The Liberalization of Agriculture and Textile Sectors in Peru and Chile* (with Roselyn Hsueh, Temple University)\n- *Identity Executioners, a New Type of Identity Entrepreneurship: Some Evidence from Lima, Peru*\n- *The Pre-Electoral Payoffs of Political Competition on Subnational Bureaucratization: Evidence from Peru’s Local Governments* (with Luis Garcia, Temple University)\n\n\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../styles.css"],"toc":true,"output-file":"index.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.335","editor":"source","theme":"flatly","title":"Research","page-layout":"full"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
